1. CI (Continuous Integration) is the process of automatically building and testing code whenever developers make changes, ensuring the codebase remains stable.
  CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) extends this by automating the release process, allowing software to be delivered to production quickly, reliably, and with minimal manual effort.
2. Automation is important in software development because it reduces human errors, speeds up repetitive tasks like testing and deployment, and ensures consistent, 
  reliable results. It also frees developers to focus on solving problems and building new features instead of doing manual work.
3. CI/CD pipelines improve teamwork by giving developers immediate feedback when code is integrated, helping them collaborate smoothly and avoid conflicts. They also improve software quality 
  by automating testing and deployment, ensuring that issues are caught early and that every release is stable and reliable.
4. When I set up a simple CI/CD pipeline, I faced challenges like configuring the workflow correctly, ensuring the environment matched development, and securely managing secrets. I also dealt 
  with unreliable tests and setting up repository integration. Overcoming these issues gave me a better understanding of automation and how CI/CD improves software quality.
